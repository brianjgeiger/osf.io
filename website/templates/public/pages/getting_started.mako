        <div class="row " >
            <p class="gs-header">Dashboards</p>
            <p>Dashboards are a table of contents of your projects or project components. The user dashboard is linked in the black navigation bar at the top of the page.  This dashboard shows your public OSF profile and all of your projects--both public and private.</p>
            <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/X0d-A5Gc3rk?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
            <p>Also, every project and component on the OSF has a dashboard of its own in the grey navigation bar below the project title.  This dashboard is an overview of the components, files, tags, history, and includes a wiki excerpt.</p>
            <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FxYFEsMmoEI?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <p class="gs-header">Projects</p>
                <p>Projects are the largest form of categorization that the OSF supports. A project could be an experiment, a lab group, or a paper–anything that has contributing members and files or explanatory texts/images.</p>
                <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/d9gxOH15EPk?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

            <div class="row" >
                <p class="gs-header">Components</p>
                <p>Components are like folders in your project. You can assign a component a category upon its creation (data, materials, projects, etc.). A component that is categorized as a project can have more components added within it.</p>
                <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/4GBfBnO_7Ks?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p>Components come with their own privacy settings, contributors, wikis, add-ons, and files.</p>
                <p>To delete a component or project, visit its page and go to "Settings" in the grey navigation bar under the component's title. This will also delete that component's wiki.</p>

            <div id="files"></div>
            <div class="row" >
                <p class="gs-header">Files</p>
                <p>Each project and component can have its own set of files. This allows you to organize your files into meaningful groups like datasets or background research.</p>
                <p>To upload a file, click on "Files" in the grey navigation bar under the Project/Component's title. Here you can drag the file from your desktop on to the screen to upload, or click on the upload button in the actions column.</p>
                <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q-fbk_6fG8Y?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p>To download a file from a project, click the download button in the actions column.</p>
                <p>You can delete files by clicking  the ‘X’ that appears when you hover over the file.</p>
                <p>Only contributors of that component with writing privileges can add or delete a file. If a component is set to be private, then no one will be able to see the enclosed files, but public components and projects allow anyone to download their materials.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="privacy"></div>
            <div class="row" >
                <p class="gs-header">Privacy</p>
                <p>All projects are private by default. However, you can choose to make your project's contents available for anyone to view. </p>
                <p>Components you have added can have their own privacy settings. Making the project public does not make all of its components public. For example, you can make your methodology component public, but leave the data in a private component.</p>
                <p>Once you make a project public, you can gain more feedback about the impact of your work by tracking how many people that are visiting your projects and downloading or forking your research materials. You can also create a watchlist of other projects that interest you. </p>

                <p class="gs-header">Contributors</p>
                <p>Adding contributors to a project allows credit to be given to those who have worked on the project, and allows them to make changes to the project.</p>
                <p>Admins on a project can add contributors by visiting the "Contributors" tab in the grey navigation bar under the project's name. Click on the top link labeled "Click to add a contributor." A pop-up will appear where you can search for a person to add. If they have an OSF account, their name will appear and you can add them and select their privileges. You can select what components you would like to add them to.</p>
                <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/acJBswJkCGo?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p><strong>Contributor permissions</strong> are the rules that govern who can see or edit a project. When a project is made, the creator is automatically the administrator, meaning that they can add other people and make changes to the project. The admin can add contributors and make them administrators as well, or they can assign the other contributors to read or read & write priveleges.<p>
                <p>Reading privileges means that the contributor can see any project or component they are listed as a contributor on.</p>
                <p>Reading and writing privileges means that the contributor can see and edit any project or component they are a contributor on, but they cannot add or remove contributors like an administrator.</p>
                <p>Admins on a project can add contributors by visiting the "Contributors" tab in the grey navigation bar under the project's name. Click on the top link labeled "Click to add a contributor." A pop-up will appear where you can search for a person to add. If they have an OSF account, their name will appear and you can add them and select their privileges. You can select what components you would like to add them to.</p>
                <P>Admins can also affect the order in which contributors are listed. To re-order, just click on a contributor and drag and drop them to their new position.</P>

                <p class="gs-header">Links</p>
                <p>Links are an alternative to building a component within a project. Adding a link to a project means that instead of building a component within the parent project, the component exists separately and is only being pointed to from the present project.</p>
                <p>Any existing public project can be a link.</p>
                <p>Linking is useful if you want to reference another's work or indicate that something is part of a larger project, while still allowing it to exist independently.</p>
                <p>A link can be by visiting the project you want to add the link to. Click "Add Links" in the components section of your project dashboard and search for the project you wish to link to.</p>

                <p class="gs-header">Forking</p>
                <p>Forking a project means you have created a copy of it into your dashboard, and can change that copy for your own purposes. You will be the only contributor to the forked project until you add others.</p>
                <p>Forks will automatically reference the original project as a functional citation.  Over time, the network of forks trace the evolution of project materials.</p>

                <p>To fork a project, visit the project and click the button at the top right of the page. This will give you several options on how you can duplicate a project. Click "Fork" and a fork will be created.</p>
                <div class="gs-video center"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/WDSsM3xr4mY?hd=1&rel=0&autohide=1&showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
                <p>A <a href="links">linked</a> project can also easily be turned into a fork. If you were originally linking to a project but would like to make edits to the linked project, from your project dashboard you can find the linked project and hit the small fork button.</p>

                <p class="gs-header">Registrations</p>
                <p>Registrations are permanent, read only copies of a project. Registration saves the state of a project at a particular point in time - such as right before data collection, or right when a manuscript is submitted.</p>
                <p>To register a project, click on the button in the grey navigation bar. Click on "New Registration", select a meta-data template, fill it out, and then confirm the registration.</p>
